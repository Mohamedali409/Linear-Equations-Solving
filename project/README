📌 Linear Equation Solver (C++)

A C++ console application to parse, manipulate, and solve systems of linear equations (up to 3x3).

🚀 Features

Parse linear equations from user input

Display number of variables

Print any equation

Print a column of coefficients

Add or subtract two equations

Solve 3x3 systems using Cramer's rule

Handles float coefficients and simple error checks

Supports commands for interactive usage (num_vars, equation, column, add, subtract, solve, quit)

🛠 Tech Stack

Language: C++

Compiler: Visual Studio (Windows) / any C++17 compatible compiler

⚙️ Installation & Build

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/username/LinearEquationSolver.git

Open the .sln file in Visual Studio.

Build the solution (Ctrl+Shift+B) or use Build → Build Solution.

Run the project (F5 or Debug → Start Debugging).

🧩 Usage

Input format example:

3
x1+2x2-3x3=5
2x1-4x2+6x3=-2
x1+x2+x3=3

Commands:

num_vars → prints the number of variables

equation <i> → prints equation number i

column x<j> → prints column j of coefficients

add <i> <j> → prints sum of equation i and j

subtract <i> <j> → prints difference of equation i and j

solve → solves the 3x3 system using Cramer's rule

quit → exits the program

⚠️ Limitations

Only supports systems up to 3 variables for solving

No GUI; console-based

Minimal error handling for invalid input
